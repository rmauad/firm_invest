In recent decades, there has been a substantial increase in the share of intangible capital within firms, potentially impacting monetary policy transmission. Firms with significant intangible assets - "Intangible firms" - often seek funding alternatives to external debt due to these assets' lower collateral value. This study employs local projection methods to investigate how changes in interest rates affect the investment behavior of publicly listed firms with varying levels of intangible capital. The results reveal that "Tangible firms," with higher physical asset holdings, show a 7% greater cumulative investment reaction after eight quarters following an interest rate change than "Intangible firms." I develop a model with collateral constraints to explore the phenomena.
